# P-Journal

P-Journal is a period tracker app for Android. The goal is not to make generic predictions or ping reminders, but to have period-related events on record so that users can reflect on their unique experiences and act accordingly.

See the "Proposed Functionality" issue for high-level goals and current progress.
